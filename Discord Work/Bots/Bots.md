# Discord Bots

Since I've been a dev, I've made dozens of custom Discord bots for individual servers, as well as a few from my early days that I attempted to promote but the skills just weren't there yet. As of now, due to various changes the platform has made to it's user experience, I have stopped developing bots for public use, and any new bots made are private. I've included a few bots I've made here for private servers.

## Bots
- Discord.js variant of the popular [Modmail](https://github.com/modmail-dev) bot, with a few custom plugins and featuring a basic ticket logs system with a website using Express and EJS. Written in JavaScript (Node.js).
- Custom bot for the [CaesarVerse](https://caesarverse.io) Discord server, of which I am no longer associated with however all bot assets are my own. Written in JavaScript (Node.js).
