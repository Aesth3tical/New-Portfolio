# Modmail Plugins

Over the years I've developed plugins for a couple of Discord modmail bots, including but not limited to [Modmail](https://github.com/modmail-dev/Modmail) and my own bot written in JavaScript. All plugins I've developed that I still have access to are listed here.

## Plugins
- Advanced Menu for Modmail (formerly known as Kyb3r Modmail). Written in Python.
- Custom Commands plugins for my own version of Modmail. Written in Javascript (Node.js)
